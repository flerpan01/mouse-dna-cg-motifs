# Reference genome statistics

Extract statistics from human and mouse reference genomes: number of (1) CG-motifs, (2) CCGG-motifs and distribution of (3) gene types. CG-motifs are interesting for the methylome as these can be methylated and DNA methylation has been shown to affect gene expression [ref](). CCGG-motifs are targets for the [restiction enzyme Mspl](https://international.neb.com/products/r0106-mspi) and are used as a reduced representation of the genome for DNA methylation. 

In mouse X % (21M / 3000M) are CG-motifs, of these X % (1.6M / 21M) are CCGG-motifs

Todo: add figure from the code, rmd?
